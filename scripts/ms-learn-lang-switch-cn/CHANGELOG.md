# Changelog

All notable changes to this script are documented in this file. Format based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this script follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-13

### Changed
- **Accessibility**: the toggle button is now a real `<button>`
  element (previously a `<div>` with an `onclick` handler), so it's
  reachable via **Tab** and activated with **Enter/Space**. Added an
  `aria-label` that announces the direction of the switch (e.g.
  "Switch to Simplified Chinese (zh-cn)"). The button also gains a
  visible white `:focus` outline so keyboard users can see where
  they are. Mouse / hover behaviour is unchanged.
- **Metadata**: `@run-at` is now explicitly `document-end` (this
  pins the script's existing behaviour — the IIFE already relies on
  `document.body` being available — and prevents accidental drift if
  a future change introduces head-time work).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Moved from gist `lettucebo/75f05f94b7ee2dace41b5ec06b6bf022` into the `lettucebo/TampermonkeyScripts` repo at `scripts/ms-learn-lang-switch-cn/`.
- Bilingual README (English + 繁體中文).
- Proper Tampermonkey metadata: `@license MIT`, `@homepageURL`, `@supportURL`, repo-based `@namespace`, and `@updateURL` / `@downloadURL` pointing at the repo raw URL so Tampermonkey can auto-update from this repo.

### Changed
- `@author` from `You` to `lettucebo`.
- `@namespace` from `http://tampermonkey.net/` to `https://github.com/lettucebo/TampermonkeyScripts`.
- `@name` from `中英快速切換 - CN` to `MS Learn Lang Switch (zh-CN)`; original Chinese name retained as `@name:zh-TW`.

### Upgrade notes
- The `@namespace` change means Tampermonkey treats this as a different script from the gist version. If you previously installed the script from the gist, uninstall the old entry from the Tampermonkey dashboard before installing from this repo to avoid two copies running.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- Initial public release on gist `lettucebo/75f05f94b7ee2dace41b5ec06b6bf022`.
