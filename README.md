# TampermonkeyScripts

> A personal collection of [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
> userscripts by [lettucebo](https://github.com/lettucebo).

Each userscript lives in its own folder under `scripts/<script-id>/`,
with its own README, CHANGELOG, and (when applicable) tests. Click an
**Install** button below to install via Tampermonkey, or open the
script's README for full details.

> **Note on repo history**: this repo was previously `lettucebo/LDC-Tools`
> and only held the LDC Batch Downloader. It was renamed and restructured
> in May 2026 to host multiple userscripts. Existing `LDC-Tools` v0.5.0
> installs of LDC will not auto-update — please re-install from the table
> below to receive 0.6.0+ updates.

## Installing a script

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser
   (available in the Chrome / Edge / Brave / Firefox stores).
2. Click an **Install** link above. Tampermonkey will open an install
   dialog — click **Install**.
3. Open a page that matches the script's `@match` rule and the script
   kicks in.

> **If clicking the link shows raw source instead of an install dialog**:
> - Make sure the Tampermonkey extension is installed and enabled.
> - Chrome 117+ requires **Developer mode** to be enabled at
>   `chrome://extensions` so Tampermonkey can trigger the install dialog.
> - Still no luck? Open the Tampermonkey dashboard →
>   **Utilities** → **Import from URL** and paste the raw URL above.

## Auto-update

Every script's header sets `@updateURL` / `@downloadURL` to this repo's
raw URL. Tampermonkey checks for new versions **once per day** by
default (adjustable in Tampermonkey settings → **Externals** →
*Update interval*).

To trigger a check immediately:

- Tampermonkey dashboard → find the script → click the ⟳ icon in the
  **Last updated** column, or
- Click **Check for userscript updates** from the Tampermonkey icon menu.

## Repo conventions

- Each userscript is in `scripts/<script-id>/` with its own
  `<script-id>.user.js`, `README.md` (+ `README.zh-TW.md` if
  bilingual), and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Per-script tag scheme: `<script-id>-v<X.Y.Z>` (e.g.
  `ldc-batch-download-v0.6.0`). See [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for
  the full procedure.
- All scripts in this repo are MIT licensed.
